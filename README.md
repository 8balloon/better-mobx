# `better-mobx`

better-mobx lets you skip a bunch of React Hook tedium, specifically `useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useContext`. (This is not a dig on Hooks -- they are way nicer than what came before, but... There Is A Better Way.)

Also it logs everything in [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en), which is nice.
