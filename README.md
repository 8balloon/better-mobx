# `better-mobx`

better-mobx is a better version of mobx that replaces a bunch of repetitive React Hook tedium, specifically `useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useContext`.

Also it logs everything in [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en), which is nice.
