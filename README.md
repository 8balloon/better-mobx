# `better-mobx`

better-mobx is a simplified replacement for mobx, mobx-react, and most parts of React hooks.

It is way more terse than hooks, way less confusing than Mobx's bajillion functions, and lets you see all of your application state in [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en), which is nice.
